# letsch_do

A simple todo app based on Flutter framework for mobile. Just another experimental coding that I've had in mind to test out and understand more what Flutter and Dart capable of doing. Was making this app little by little during the weekends in this weird time of pandemic. Also a good way of showcasing my mobile app development and Flutter and Dart coding ablility. 

## Download
I still don't have a version that I've satisfied enough to make a release out of it at the moment, as most of the bits and pieces are still wasn't there yet to be called complete.

## Screenshot
To-be featured soon.

## Does it work?
For the basic stuff, yea.. At least adding some task todo into this app will be saved into the database so that won't go away after the app closes.

More features to be completed.

## Incoming features
- Automatic reschedulling of the unfinished tasks to the next day
- Set daily alert with changeable timing, and additional feature to only buzz the notification if there's task scheduled for the day

## Where's the project came from?
Just wanna understand more of Flutter and Dart. Tutorials online can get you so far, so I thought of building something that I want, and digging through the documentations and tutorials to make it happened.
